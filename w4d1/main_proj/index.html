	  <p>We have created a page to show off our new knowledge in the realm of web development. Under the instruction of Generation Code's one and only Andrew Lee, Allen, Diana, Isabel, and Dylan departed on a journey. However, before it began, ominous signs showed themselves as the supposedly group of seven was only four. As days passed the course became increasingly difficult. Their wits, minds, and wills were tested and they were pushed past their limits and to the breaking point. Part of the way through the course there Isabel Gormley had a mental breakdown and was not able to recover. She left the course and departed to the Hamptons to recover. Dylan, Diana, and Allen seeing their fellow coder now in the git initted terminal powered through. This is their story. A story of minds, keybroards, and wills. On the first day of the two-thousand-seventeenth August Anno Domini, Dylan Robert Porges, Diana Nicole Bates Zoullas, and Allen Carter Hinckley III completed the treacherous, mindfufilling task that was WEBDEV1.</p>
