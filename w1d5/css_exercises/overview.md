#### Hints:

1. Look up and figure out the difference between display: inline; vs. display: inline-block;
2. Use **relative pathing** to link the pictures to your page.  Remember file structure.

Think of file structure as a list.

<img src="./brook_lyn/images/file_structure.jpg"/>
 
If my index.html is at the very beginning of fun_thangs_folder, and I need to link pic1.jpg, I'd do this...

```
<img src="./folder_a/pic1.jpg"/>
```

If I need to get to get pic3.jpg, I'd do this...

```
<img src="./folder_b/pic3.jpg"/>
```

If I need to get pic4.jpg, I'd do this...

```
<img src="./folder_c/unfun_folder/pic4.jpg"/>
```
